During Stackathon at Fullstack Academy, I wanted to study about code and motion graphic. In 4 days, I researched, studied and created this interactive illustration with 3D parallax effect allows user to responsively interact with the artwork. this project developed using HTML canvas, CSS,  Javascript, and Tween.js.
